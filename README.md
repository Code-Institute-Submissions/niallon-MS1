# niallon Band Webpage
----------
This is the main webpage for the band niallon, its purpose is to generate a new fanbase whilst connecting with existing fans and  to showcase
their material.

## UX Design
----------
### Strategy
The main aim of this webpage is to branch out further from social media pages, where different content can be found in different areas can now 
be found in one convenient place with access to all areas at the touch of a button.
In these uncertain times, bookings/concerts etc are not an option and could generate unnecessary pressure on the band itself, as such this option was
traded off in favour of generating a larger fanbase for the future.
