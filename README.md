# niallon Band Webpage
----------
This is the main webpage for the band niallon, its purpose is to generate a new fanbase whilst connecting with existing fans and  to showcase
their material.

## User Experience (UX)
----------
### Strategy

The main aim of this webpage is to branch out further from social media pages, where different content can be found in different areas can now 
be found in one convenient place with access to all areas at the touch of a button.
In these uncertain times, bookings/concerts etc are not an option and could generate unnecessary pressure on the band itself, as such this option was
traded off in favour of generating a larger fanbase for the future.

#### Design
- Imagery <br>
The banner image for the site is the main focal point for the user, I chose this image as I 
felt it described the bands aesthetic best. The image itself is striking even though it is in black and white,
the different shades and tones make it both striking and pleasing to the eye. 

- Colour Scheme <br>
The colour scheme for this site was matched to the tones and shades in the main banner image. The 
fonts and backgrounds contrast with each other between black, off-white and a steel grey. I chose 
these colours as not only did they tie to the focal point of the page itself but they are also clear and easy to read.
The only other colour that features on this site is a grey-blue to show any links on hover
and it also fits in to the overall colour scheme.


- Typography <br>
The page has two fonts that serve two different purposes, "East Sea Dokdo", for the nav-brand logo, nav-links and footer headings. I specifically
chose this font as it has an arty, fun feel to it which reflects the band itself.
The "Roboto" font makes up the rest of the site fonts which was chosen as it is a popular font right now 
and will add a familiarity to new users.
Both fonts are backed up by the sans-serif font.

- Continuity <br>
The page is designed to be completely user-friendly. All of the elements are clear and accessible with added descriptive links 
to guide the user to where they wish to go. All 3 pages on the site follow the same design format as to not overload the user
and cause confusion. Elements are spaced, with clear fonts and to the point with a lot of visual cues 
making the overall user experience to be enjoyable and familiar.




#### Features:
- Responsive across all devices.
